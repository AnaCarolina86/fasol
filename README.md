# Fasol Moda Praia

This web application will be a land page for a family business. Its focus is swimming clothes, mostly personalized  bikinis. 
I am working in collaboration with a graphic designer who is part of the family company. Also, I am a friend of the family 
for many years, and I am more than happy in building this web application for free for them. Moreover, I am creating an 
interface with the aim of allowing them to manage the content of the website, using a login system. You can check it out in
